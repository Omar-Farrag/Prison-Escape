Listen carefully to me...I don't like repeating myself
You're gonna be my assistant here
Mahowa if you let me finish my sentence you will find out
Anyways while you're working here I'll ask you to do a few things for me
Simple stuff you know like getting stuff from the fridge, putting things in the oven etc...
You may occasionally need to make tea and send it to guards...
Two things actually... First of all, don't piss me off
See words like 'Obviously' and 'Of course' piss me off
Don't snoop around...I don't like snoopers...You a snooper?
Well promise all you want...We will see what kind of person you are
LOOOOLLL...Yeah you probably will but whatever...
