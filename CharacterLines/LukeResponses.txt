I did something terrible that I will regret for the rest of my life
I am not a criminal though...I used to be the CEO of a large company
That's true but I wasn't one of them...I was straight as an arrow
One time I had an important meeting in another country so I needed to travel..
I was kinda late so I started driving a little too fast
Those are rookie numbers my guy...I was actually at 220 Km/hr
I was driving a pink Bugatti Veyron on a German autobahn
Well what color is your bugatti?? 
Whatever man...Anyways I don't know what happened but I suddenly lost control of the car
I skewed off into the other side of the road and t-boned another car 
It was a family car...two kids were in the car...They all died that day
I do...I wish I had died with them that day instead of living the rest of my life with the survivor's guilt
Well I still get nightmares at night but the prison doc did me a solid
From time to time he hooks me up with anesthetic drugs that help me sleep
Yeah
Alright
