Al Hamdolellah  my brother what about you?
Of course my brother...I have a question: you a believer or not?
Very nice...as long as you stop your wrongdoing and repent...God will forgive you 
You will be amazed by how merciful God is. All it takes is your commitment.
For starters, make sure you carry out your prayers daily
Be kind to other people, read the Qur'an, and keep God's name in your tongue
No problem my friend...I am glad I was helpful...
