Hey there man why you sad
Man you're crying in the middle of the open yard...Are you insane?
My guy other prisoners will take you for a sissy...You never wanna be that person in prison
I am so sorry man
He made his own choices...You couldn't have nothing more from your side
Well he's already left this world...at least he won't have to eat the prison soup anymore ^-)
May God have mercy on his soul
