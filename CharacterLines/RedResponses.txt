I got some connections
Anything you want as long as it's small...
Not much...Just a single c-note
What were you expecting??? There is a lot of risk involved...this ain't Amazon express delivery
Think about it...all the risk is in getting the item into prison...If I get caught I am in big trouble...
So you're one of those people who like to haggle?
Fruitful?? Man just either give me the money now or get lost...Besides what you tryna get anyways?
Well you know what, this is your first purchase of my services so I will give you a discount...
I am not gonna get it for you but I will tell you where you can find it here in prison...It'll cost you 20$ only
So look...There is a workshop here that has some tools...There is a very good chance you will find a hammer there...
If you get caught you don't know and I don't know you...clear??
Pleasure not doing business with you ^-)
