Living the prison life...What you in for?
Insider trading...Got slapped a 7 year sentence
Around 5...
That may be true but what's the point. I have already lost everything
I hope
I guess its the safest place to be...Guards are close by and it's emptier here
You step out there and if the other inmates sense your fear...You are gonna be harassed for the rest of your time here
First time I went out there...Oh man I slept in the infirmary that day
You better be...
