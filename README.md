# PRISON ESCAPE PROJECT

## Description

An adventurous, open world, command line and text based role-playing game set in prison. The player spawns in his cell and interacts with surroundings to find clues that can help him escape prison. Additionally, the player can use a phone to
punch/dodge during fist fights, play basketball, and lift dumbbells. The game also has a very dynamic nature where the player's actions can influence in-game events. Throughout the game, the player has a good-bad index: good behavior provides greater access to prison rooms while bad behavior frees the player from harrassment by other inmates.
